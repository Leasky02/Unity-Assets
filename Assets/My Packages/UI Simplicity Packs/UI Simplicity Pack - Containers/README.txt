Thank you for downloading the 'UI Simplicity Pack: Containers' asset package. If you have
any questions or issues, don't hesitate to get in touch. If you could be so kind as to leave a review of this package, 
that would be fantastic as it really helps me out.

Thanks again!

Additional Guidance:

1. Drag an image into the sprite field of an image component
2. In the 'Rect Transform', set the width and height to the dimensions displayed
   in the file name of the image from step 1

Resolution:

- HD is recommended for standard projects as file sizes are more optimal
- 4K is recommended only if your project is expected to be displayed in that resolution
- If using 4K within a HD resolution, ensure you divide the width and height in the 'Rect 
  Transform' by two (/2) to get the intended element sizes

Customisability:

- All elements can be set to any colour through the colour property in the 'Image' 
  and 'Sprite' component. You can also set the element transparency this way through
  the alpha value
- These assets have been designed to reduce the need for resizing, but you can change
  the dimensions and ratios as required for your project
